  <h1 class="display-3">Welcome to Kshamata!</h1>
  <p class="lead">Kshamata seeks to primarily de-institutionalize survivors of trafficking and women in institutions. For this, Kshamata would provide relevant support services, to facilitate the transition from State- and NGO-sponsored aftercare homes to greater personal autonomy.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>We aim to work with the whole range of women in distress – homeless, destitute, and survivors of different kinds of exploitation, especially women trafficked for prostitution or bonded labour – to help them recover their dignity in life and enable satisfactory psychological, social and economic reintegration.</p>
